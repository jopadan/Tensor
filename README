tensor library
	- covariant and contravariant indexes
	- compressed symmetric and antisymmetric storage
	- lots of compile time and template driven stuff

taken from my relativity project, working it into a C++ verison of my hydrodynamics project

Depends on the "Common" project

requires C++11

TODO:
- get rid fo the Grid class.  
	The difference between Grid and Tensor is allocation: Grid uses dynamic allocation, Tensor uses static allocation.
	Intead, make the allocator of each dimension a templated parameter: dynamic vs static.
	This will give dynamically-sized tensors all the operations of the Tensor template class without having to re-implement them all for Grid.
	This will allow for flexible allocations: a degree-2 tensor can have one dimension statically allocated and one dimension dynmamically allocated
